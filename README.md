This project provides an interactive interface for text generation using OpenAI's GPT-2 model. Leveraging Gradio and the Transformers library, users can input text prompts and receive GPT-2 generated completions in real-time. The interface is designed for ease of use, allowing users to explore the capabilities of GPT-2 for creative writing, story generation, and more. With customizable parameters and straightforward deployment, this tool serves as a practical demonstration of advanced natural language processing techniques.

The bar graph shows user interactions with the system based on different prompts. Each prompt, such as "How are you?", "Tell me a story", and "Generate a poem", is represented on the x-axis, while the number of requests made for each prompt is represented on the y-axis. The bar heights reflect the frequency of user engagement with each prompt, giving insight into user preferences and usage patterns.

This visualization helps to understand which prompts are most popular among users, providing valuable feedback for improving the system or tailoring content to better meet user needs. Additionally, it can inform decisions related to prompt selection or content generation strategies, ultimately enhancing the user experience and effectiveness of the system.

In the example usage, the code demonstrates how to generate a table with two rows, each containing an input prompt and its generated text. This table provides a clear and structured way to present the input-output pairs generated by the GPT-2 model, facilitating easy interpretation and analysis of the generated text.
